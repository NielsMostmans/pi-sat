# Pi-Sat
Provides a cFS distribution that can be run on a Raspberry Pi. It includes a gpio_demo app that blinks an LED connected to the Piâ€™s GPIO.
Refer to OpenSatKit's [Pi-Sat Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/OpenSatKit/OpenSatKit/blob/master/cosmos/config/targets/PISAT/docs/Pi-Sat-Quick-Start.pdf) for more details.

OpenSatKit's v3.2 will include a COSMOS-to-Pi interface that allows the GPIO demo app to be run from COSMOS over a WiFi connection to the Pi.
